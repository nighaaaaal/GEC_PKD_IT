## üöÄ How to Use

This repository serves as my personal archive. Here‚Äôs how I manage it:

1.  **Cloning the Repository:**
    To get a local copy on my machine, I use:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nighaaaaal/GEC_PKD_IT.git
    ```

2.  **Adding New Files:**
    As I complete new assignments, labs, or take notes, I add them to the correct subject folder.

3.  **Committing and Pushing:**
    I regularly commit my changes with clear, descriptive messages and push them to GitHub to keep everything backed up and synced.
    ```bash
    # Stage the files
    git add .

    # Commit with a meaningful message
    git commit -m "Add notes for DSA Module 3"

    # Push to the remote repository
    git push origin main
    ```

## üìù Notes on Best Practices

* **Ignoring Compiled Files:** For programming labs, I use a `.gitignore` file to exclude compiled executables (like `a.out`) and build directories from being pushed to the repository. This keeps the repo clean and focused on source code.
* **Meaningful Commits:** I use clear commit messages to create a useful history of my work, making it easy to find specific files or changes later.

This repository is a personal project for academic organization. Feel free to browse, but its primary purpose is for my own use.
